# Burd-I Burden - introduction


## BURDENING INTERFACE & BURDEN CALCULATION MODEL

The BLT® Burdening Interface, with the integrated Burden Calculation Model, is an innovative ‘recipe based’ application for blast furnace charging. A recipe is defined as a composition in terms of raw materials, chemical analysis, corresponding weight bases, injection rates, material position on the main conveyor and charging matrix. 
The user-friendly recipe definition, together with the possibility of saving, filtering and loading, as well as editing recipes, minimizes the time requirements and sources of input errors.

Within one integrated user-friendly application, the BLT® Burdening Interface and Burden Calculation Model handle all charging related steps. This includes, amongst others, burden calculation as well as defining composition & charging matrixes. In between these steps, the system performs multiple consistency checks. User input values are checked in order to see if the values are within the limits of the operation of stock-house (extractor availably,...) and BLT® (hopper volume, …).

The Burden Calculation is a central integrated model that ensures that the targeted burden composition is kept stable as the chemical composition and weight of the raw materials change. To overcome complicated recipe updating procedures, a concept of relative recipe definition was developed by Paul Wurth. The main benefit is that the weights allocated to batches are expressed in a relative manner, i.e. in percentages of the nominal charge.

Upon raw material composition change coming from the integrated Analysis Management Tool, the only figures to be changed to update the recipe are the raw material weights per ton of hot metal to keep the hot metal quality constant.

The batch composition and BLT setting check give additional safety to this procedure. The new weights will be transferred to the interface. Upon request to put the recipe into production, it is checked for potential errors or problems.

The model can be displayed either by clicking on "Burd-I” in the list of Process models in the BFXpert main menu or, if already started, by clicking on the corresponding quick access tab on the top of the screen.

The model consists of a step-by-step approach; at any moment you can see the progression of your recipe. Each step has to be validated to move on to the next one.


## BURD-I WORKFLOW
### step-by-step approach
Burd-I is based on a 4 steps approach to create a recipe.

1. Open/Create a recipe
2. Burden Calculation
3. Composition Matrix
4. Charging Matrix

### What is a recipe? 

A recipe is composed of all the information below:
* A unique name
* a unique id
* a revision
* a group
* etc.
* Burden calculation
  * Target & Set point
  * Weight reference
  * materials
  * reducing agent
  * target Basicity
  * Eq. coke rate
  * analysis
  * etc.
* Composition Matrix 
  * cycle of batches
  * extractors from stockhouse
  * hopper volume
  * etc.
* Charging Matrix
  * BLT settings
  * mode 
    * revolution
    * percentage
    * rotation
  * etc.
